Version 1.3:
- WifiManager.reconnect() made no difference, so it is removed
- Remade the way TimeWindow's are found, so that instead of finding windows from current 
	time and forth, it finds TimeWindow's from the next quarter and forth (ie. from 
	xx:00, xx:15, xx:30 and xx:45)
- Changed the way TimeWindow's are found from using java.util.Calendar, to using 
	android.text.format.Time
- Added global config file, so instead of manually configuring each tablet, only the global
	config file needs changing. When it is changed, the tablets pull it down themselves.
- Changed NewEditActivity.setTimePickers() from using java.util.SimpleDateFormat to using
	android.text.format.Time
- Removed references to java.util.Date in MainActivity
- Removed the java.text.Format from CalEvent, and calls to CalEvents constructor
- Added notification element in the notification bar

Version 1.2:
- Added WifiManager.reconnect() in the timer in MainActivity

Version 1.1:
- Fixed cached date issue. 
	The problem happens when the application have been running for over a day. 
	When that happened, the call to java.util.Calendar.get(), returned the date from the day before. 
	Now android.text.format.Time is used.
	This was a problem in NewEditActivity.add() and NewEditActivity.update()
- Found Attendee testing code, which always added "meetingroom@test.rootdomain" as an attendee.
	This is no longer needed, as the policy on attendee notification have changed.
	
Version 1.0:
- Initial release
