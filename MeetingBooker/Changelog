TODO notification bar element

Version 1.2:
- Added WifiManager.reconnect() in the timer in MainActivity

Version 1.1:
- Fixed cached date issue. 
	The problem happens when the application have been running for over a day. 
	When that happened, the call to java.util.Calendar.get(), returned the date from the day before. 
	Now android.text.format.Time is used.
	This was a problem in NewEditActivity.add() and NewEditActivity.update()
- Found Attendee testing code, which always added "meetingroom@test.rootdomain" as an attendee.
	This is no longer needed, as the policy on attendee notification have changed.
	
Version 1.0:
- Initial release
