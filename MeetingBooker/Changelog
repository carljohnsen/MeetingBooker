Version 1.6:
- Added ManagementServer, which is a socket server, so that the configuration server, can connect
	to the application.

Version 1.5:
- Added remote logging:
	- As a timer in MainActivity in onCreate(), and as remote logs in endMeeting() 
		and startNextMeeting()
	- As a function in StatMeth: remoteLog()
	- As remote logs from NewEditActivity in add(), update() and delete()
	- As remote logs from SettingsActivity in PasswordFragment (when updating password) and save()
- The adress for the remote logging server, is added as an setting (Default value is "not_set")
- Changed from storing configuration password as cleartext, to storing as a md5 hash in 
	StatMeth.md5() Chose md5, because the password is not crucial, as it is only used for 
	the application configuration.

Version 1.4:
- Instead of meetings being deleted as a result of delay (ie. no one has pressed the start) 
	it now appends "not started" at the end of the meeting description, and turns the background
	to yellow. This is done with the new setting MainActivity.canDelayDelete
- Changed some of the variable names of some of the settings, to make them more self explanatory
- NOTE: The application will not write "- not started" unless the setting canExtendStart is set 
	to true.

Version 1.3:
- WifiManager.reconnect() made no difference, so it is removed
- Remade the way TimeWindow's are found, so that instead of finding windows from current 
	time and forth, it finds TimeWindow's from the next quarter and forth (ie. from 
	xx:00, xx:15, xx:30 and xx:45)
- Changed the way TimeWindow's are found from using java.util.Calendar, to using 
	android.text.format.Time
- Added global config file, so instead of manually configuring each tablet, only the global
	config file needs changing. When it is changed, the tablets pull it down themselves.
- Changed NewEditActivity.setTimePickers() from using java.util.SimpleDateFormat to using
	android.text.format.Time
- Removed references to java.util.Date in MainActivity
- Removed the java.text.Format from CalEvent, and calls to CalEvents constructor
- Added notification element in the notification bar

Version 1.2:
- Added WifiManager.reconnect() in the timer in MainActivity

Version 1.1:
- Fixed cached date issue. 
	The problem happens when the application have been running for over a day. 
	When that happened, the call to java.util.Calendar.get(), returned the date from the day before. 
	Now android.text.format.Time is used.
	This was a problem in NewEditActivity.add() and NewEditActivity.update()
- Found Attendee testing code, which always added "meetingroom@test.rootdomain" as an attendee.
	This is no longer needed, as the policy on attendee notification have changed.
	
Version 1.0:
- Initial release
